        <h1>P4A Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>This privacy policy describes how P4A (“perfect4alexa”, “us” or “we”) protects your (“you”, “the user”)
            privacy and your data. Before using any of our Alexa Skills (“our skills”), please read this policy and our
            <a href="terms.html">Alexa Skills Terms of Use</a>, as well as the <a
                href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201809740">Alexa Terms of Use</a> and
            the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/privacy">Privacy Policies</a> by the Amazon Digital Services LLC (with
            its affiliates, “Amazon”).</p>

        <p>Regarding Amazon, “Alexa” means their Alexa Voice Service which includes third party services (like our
            skills) and other related Software.</p>

        <p>If you use one of our skills you fully agree to this privacy policy.</p>

        <h2>General</h2>

        <p>When you use our skills you have to talk to Alexa. This voice input is sent to Amazon and us where we use it
            to understand what our skill should do for you. This is absolutely necessary for our service to give you an
            appropriate answer.</p>

        <h2>Data</h2>

        <p>We never collect or share personal data with our skills.</p>

        <p>To improve our services we analyze how often utterances are spoken and other data related to how our skills
            are used and performing. Most of this is done automatically by Amazon in the Amazon Developer Portal. Other
            data, like error messages, are logged and reviewed manually.</p>

        <p>For some of our skills it is necessary to save data for you in our databases (e.g. lifetime score in a game).
            This data is only connected to your Alexa-UserId, or PersonID if you are using the Voice Profiles feature of
            Alexa, but never to your name or any other personal information.</p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>

        <p>Our skills or parts of it may change or be updated at any time. Further, this Privacy Policy might change.
            You can find a link to this policy on the description page of the skill in the Alexa App or in the Alexa
            Store. Your continued use of our skill after changes of the Privacy Policy or the skill itself will be seen
            as your acceptance of both.</p>
